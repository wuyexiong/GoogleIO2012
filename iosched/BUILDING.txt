You can use ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or pretty much any IDE
to compile the app. Before building, you should ensure that:

1) You've read 'libs/README.txt' and have placed the necessary
   JARs into the 'libs' directory.

2) You've added the ActionBarSherlock library project as a
   dependency.

3) Your Eclipse/IDEA/ant/etc. project targets API level 16 or
   higher.

Forgetting to do any of these will result in compile errors.
